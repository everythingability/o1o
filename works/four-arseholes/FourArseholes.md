# The Four Arseholes Of The Apocalypse

According to some, the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse had scary names. There was Conquest, War, Famine, and Death.  And what do get given? More than four nasty and useless arseholes.  

I had planned to do the entire cabinet, but if you go and look at them, they don't deserve the attention. Such a stunning lack of ability.
