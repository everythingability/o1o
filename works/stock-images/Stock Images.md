# Stock Images

![[stock6.jpg]]

I began using cows as a motif for lots of reasons. I mainly used *stock image* site for the sources.

* They were around me
* One surprised me on a walk
* They are black and white, like so many things in life aren't
* They are *living industrialisation* 
* They are a two horned, cloven hoofed relation to gnus, a motif I was attempting to leave behind. I hoped they'd become a *gateway spirit animal* somehow

And I found that loosening the parameters of watmap to use larger image fragments produced images that were definitely recognisable as the thing itself AND the thing. It both was the thing, and the thing, er, butchered.

My adapted version of Watmap would produce hundreds of images, of which maybe 10% were what I had in mind.
