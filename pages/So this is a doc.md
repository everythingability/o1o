# So this is a doc

Can I add images?



![Sigh!](sigh.png)



## What Can I do?

I can do this...

* Can I link to  [Something Else](Something Else.md) is raw Markdown

* Or can I do [Something Else as HTML?](Something Else.html)
  * Or maybe [Something Else][Something Else] this format, two sets of square brackets.



## What Else Can I do?

So when I export as HTML ... the links don't get converted, so what's the point of that?
